# Create and insert documents into the 'owners' collection
db.owners.insertMany([

# a. Display area-wise property details

# b. Display property owned by 'Abhishek Shinde' having minimum rate
db.properties.find({ owner_id: 1 }).sort({ rate: 1 }).limit(1)

# c. Give the details of the owner whose property is at "Nashik"
db.properties.aggregate([

# d. Display area of property whose rate is less than 100000
